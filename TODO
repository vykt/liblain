[developing]:
- While there are unit tests, they catch far from
  everything. To ensure your changes work, inspect
  state with a gdb using the provided macros.


[bugs]:
- Change error code `LIBCMORE` -> `CMORE`
- Modify GDB scripts to pretty print areas, objs and nodes
  with `printf` instead of crudely using `p`. Maybe add a
  'p' prefix, for "pretty"? e.g.: `epparean`?


[features]:
- add 3rd interface that uses process_vm_readv/process_vm_writev
