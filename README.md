### ABOUT:

**The Memcry Library () provides**:

- Graph-like data structure (*map*) for representing the memory map of a target process.
- The ability to update the *map* as the target's memory mappings change without invalidating pointers to the *map*.
- Tracking of (assumed) ownership of unnamed `vm_area`s.
- Support for **multiple interfaces** for acquiring the memory maps, reading and writing memory.
- Multiple convenient utilities.

### DEPENDENCIES:

If you're not using a packaged release, you'll need to install:

- [CMore](https://github.com/vykt/cmore) - Data structures for C.


### EXAMPLE:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <memcry.h>
#include <cmore.h>

	 *  First, find the PID of the target based on the target's name. You can
	 *  optionally pass a pointer to an uninitialised CMore vector if you want

## TL;DR





Memcry is a memory manipulation library. It's des

Memcry provides two views of a target's memory: areas


`mc_vm_map` can be updated at any time by calling `mc_update_map()`.
Most importantly, updating the map does not invalidate any existing
pointers. Instead any areas discovered to no longer be mapped are
moved to unmapped lists inside `mc_vm_map`, and their `mapped` flags
are set to `false`.


## Interfaces:

As an obfuscation measure your target may be watching for memory
accesses through some system APIs. Memcry performs all operations
through _interfaces_. An interface provides read & write primitives, and
a method to acquire the target's memory map. The library comes with support
for two interfaces:

- procfs (included)
- krncry (WIP kernel module, get [here](https://github.com/vykt/krncry))


## Utils:

Memcry also offers some QoL utils:

- Finding the PID of a target by name the exact way ps & top do.
- A fast address -> area/object search.
- Offset & bound offset getters.
